# Restaurant Reviews App: Stage 1

## Overview

The restaurant review app is a mobile-ready web application which is used for searching various restaurants based on their locality and cuisines, and view their respective reviews.
For this project, I have converted a static webpage to this mobile friendly web application with a responsive design for proper display on different sized devices and accessible for screen reader use. I have also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Origin

The static starter code has been forked from this [Udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).
Following are the areas on which I've worked for this project:
- Responsive Design,
- Accessibility and
- Offline Use.

## How to use app

* To run the app locally:
1. Clone this git repository or the download the ZIP file from [https://github.com/sidinsomniac/restaurant-review-app](https://github.com/sidinsomniac/restaurant-review-app).
2. In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to open the app in your browser.
